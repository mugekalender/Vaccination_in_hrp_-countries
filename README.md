As of 2021, over 235 million people need humanitarian assistance and protection. In March 2020, the UN launched the **Global Response Plan for Covid-19**
in order to respond to three strategic priorities:

    Contain the spread of the virus and decrease morbidity and mortality. 
    Decrease the deterioration of human assets and rights, social cohesion, food security and livelihoods. 
    Protect, assist and advocate for refugees, IDPs, migrants and host communities particularly vulnerable to the virus.

In the scope of Global Humanitarian Overview 2021, the following countries have country-specific humanitarian response plans:
Afghanistan, Burundi, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Colombia, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC),
Ethiopia, Haiti, Iraq, Libya, Mali, Myanmar, Mozambique (new), Niger, Nigeria, occupied Palestinian territories, Pakistan (new),
Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, Ukraine, Venezuela, Yemen and Zimbabwe (new). Further on in this countries will be named 
as HRP countries.

COVAX (for further information: https://www.gavi.org/covax-facility) has allocated 73M doses of vaccines to HRP countries in 
its first round. Unlike the forecasted doses, vaccines are being delivered to HRP countries remain  small quantities. Also, 
vaccine administration rates remain low in HRP countries.

This programme aim to visualise HRP countries' vaccine situations based on the dataset published on The Humanitarian Data
Exchange (https://data.humdata.org/dataset/covid-19-vaccine-doses-in-hrp-countries)







 Lower administration of vaccines remains a challenge in HRP countries. Based on available data, of the 21 million doses 
 delivered in HRP countries only 3.5 million have been administered. As of 31 March, for every 165 people globally receiving 
 a dose of COVID-19 vaccine only one person resided in a country with a Humanitarian Response Plan.
